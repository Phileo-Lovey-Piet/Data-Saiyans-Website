				<h1>About Us</h1>

<p>Our vision at Mzamomtsha Primary School is to empower students to acquire,
  demonstrate, articulate and value knowledge and skills that will support
  them, as life-long learners, to participate in and contribute to the global
  world and practice the core values of the school: respect, tolerance &
  inclusion, and excellence.</p>

<p>Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, a sense
   of understanding and compassion for others, and the courage to act on their
   beliefs. We stress the total development of each child: spiritual, moral,
   intellectual, social, emotional, and physical.</p>
